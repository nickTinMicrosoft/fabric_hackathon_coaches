Model the Data & Build a Report / Dashboard 1 hour

Now that your data is ingested, transformed, and enriched with Azure AI, it’s time to pull it all together and tell the story.

Your goal in this section is to model the data and build a report or dashboard that showcases the insights you’ve uncovered.

What to Do
    • Combine your tables into a clean data model
    • Create relationships between your Lakehouse tables/views
    • Add calculated columns or measures where needed
    • Build a Power BI report or real‑time dashboard to highlight your findings

Ideas & Suggestions

To help the hackathon participants get creative, here are some simple and fun directions they can go:

Modeling Ideas
    • Create relationships between “fact” and “dimension” tables
    • Build DAX measures (totals, averages, YoY growth, etc.)
    • Add a semantic model to simplify the schema for reporting
    • Use Direct Lake so the dashboard reflects live Lakehouse data

Dashboard / Report Ideas
    • Build a summary dashboard showing high‑level KPIs
    • Create an AI‑powered “Insights” page using Smart Narratives
    • Use slicers to let users explore patterns by date, category, or region
    • Add visuals that highlight anomalies found by Azure AI
    • Build a simple “Ask a Question” Q&A visual so users can query the model in natural language
    • Create a “Before vs After AI Enrichment” comparison page
    • Build a drill‑through page to dive deeper into any record or segment

Creative Optional Add‑Ons
    • Add bookmarks or buttons to create a guided storytelling experience
    • Use themes to brand your dashboard
    • Add a KPI card that uses conditional formatting (red/yellow/green)
    • Build a mini‑“Copilot‑style” insights page showing AI-generated summaries from your enriched data
    • Add a tooltip page with deeper insights when hovering over visuals
